## Bridge

Bridges allow travelers to cross a river, valley, or crevasse, by walking over them. Bridges are wide enough to have ((Rank + 1) x 2) persons, or half as many Large mounts, walking abreast on them at a time.

Bridges must be in a relatively straight line, spanning only one significant gap in the terrain. Particularly large gaps may require multiple Bridges be built to fully span them. Bridges do not fill the terrain they pass over, letting rivers or travelers pass under them.

When constructed, you may decide to make a Bridge a Drawbridge. Drawbridges are controlled at a single place somewhere adjacent to the bridge itself, and can be raised or lowered as a Standard Action by someone standing at that location.

## Commons

Commons are a place where Heroes and citizens can mingle, relax, and communicate with one another. It might be a scenic park, a pavilion, a parade square, or other open space with plenty of seating (and tables, typically). When the town needs to gather to listen to a speech, hold an election, get organized to respond to a disaster, or just to have a party, the townspeople will gather at a Commons.

Heroes who speak to the gathered populace at a Commons as part of a Trait Check get a bonus to the roll, equal to ((Rank + 1) / 2).

## Cooking Fixture

A Cooking Fixture is a hearth, oven, stove, barbeque pit, a cauldron, or even a fully stocked kitchen. It has enough space on it to use five Ingredients to make Dishes or Elixirs and provide their own heat - be it through wood, coal, heat runes, or even electricity or propane in more advanced societies.

Many Buildings come equipped with Cooking Fixtures; those that can be used by Heroes are mentioned in their respective entries.

> **Cooking Fixture Rank and Master Mode Rules**
>
> By default, the Rank of a Cooking Fixture does not determine the quality of goods it can make – thus, a Rank 0 Cooking Fixture is as good as a Rank 5 Cooking Fixture. However, under the Master Mode “Forge Quality” rule, a Cooking Fixture can only be used to make items of a Rank equal to or less than its own. Because of this, if you want to have a reason to upgrade a Cooking Fixture, or to build Cooking Fixtures of higher quality, we strongly recommend using the “Forge Quality” Master Mode rule.

## Fence

Fences are small barriers, used to demarcate property lines and to keep casual interlopers out, or farm animals in. Against a determined intruder, though, they provide little protection.

Fences are, at most, one storey tall. Fences do provide cover, but do not block line of sight – they have gaps enough that a person on one side of a Fence can see persons on the other side.

Fences must either go in a relatively straight line, or circumscribe a single self-contained area. Fences may feature gates, allowing passage to authorized persons at a specific place along the Fence.

Fences may be scaled with an Athletics check of ((Rank + 1) x 2) or more.

## Forge

A Forge is essentially a large oven, no taller than a single storey, built to smelt metal. It uses a bellows to push air into the oven to keep the fires extremely hot.

Forges are required for a wide variety of crafting activities, making them essential to Heroes who wish to make the best Armor, Tools, and Weapons that they can.

> **Forge Rank and Master Mode Rules**

Because of this, if you want to have a reason to upgrade a Forge, or to build Forges of higher quality, we strongly recommend using the “Forge Quality” Master Mode rule.

## Heavy Weapon

Heavy Weapons are used by armies when fighting against, or from, fortified positions. These weighty Large-sized devices might be cannons, catapults, or trebuchets, depending on the tech level of your game world. Too large and heavy for a single Hero to carry, they are powerful, stationary weapons.

**Heavy Weapons require (Rank x 2) base Smithing to craft.**

Heavy Weapons require one hand to be firedor loaded. They can be pushed with two hands, as if the mover(s) were Slowed (except on Roads, which allow full speed). They can’t be rolled over Difficult Terrain, but can be carried – requiring four hands total.

Multiple Heroes may work together to provide the necessary number of hands for an action – for instance, two Heroes could roll a cannon down a road with one hand each, moving on the slower Hero’s turn.

Heavy Weapons cannot fire and be moved in the same round. Once fired, they cannot move; once moved, they cannot be fired.

Heavy Weapons use Bombs or Cannonballs as ammunition. Loading a Heavy Weapon is a Minor action, and firing it uses the “Launch Shell” Basic Attack. Heavy Weapons lose Durability with use, as any Weapon would.

Heavy Weapons can be made in a Crafting Style and Enchanted, as a Ranged Weapon. The higher the Rank of the Heavy Weapon used to fire a Bomb or Cannonball, the more damage it deals and the further it can fly.

**Heavy Weapons have an Accuracy of 3.**  
Crafting Styles *can* reduce their Attack below 1 (or make it negative!).

| Rank   | ATK | DUR | Range  |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| Rank 0 | 0   | 3   | 10 sq. |
| Rank 1 | 2   | 6   | 15 sq. |
| Rank 2 | 4   | 9   | 20 sq. |
| Rank 3 | 6   | 12  | 25 sq. |
| Rank 4 | 8   | 15  | 30 sq. |
| Rank 5 | 10  | 20  | 40 sq. |

### Basic Attack: Launch Shell

This Basic Attack can only be used with a Heavy Weapon. Unlike most Basic Attacks, this one does not take advantage of the user’s Combat or Willpower – the damage is up to the Heavy Weapon and its ammunition.

Remember that this is a Projectile attack; as such, if *any* foe is adjacent to you, then *all* foes are Hard to Hit with a Heavy Weapon.

When a Bomb is fired from a Heavy Weapon, it explodes immediately upon impact. If your attack misses, the Bomb has no effect.

Step-Mines, Bombchu, and Powder Kegs cannot be fired from Heavy Weapons.

**Requires**: Heavy Weapon  
**Range**: Projectile, Heavy Weapon’s range (see above)  
**Damage**: Heavy Weapon + Ammunition  
**Effect**: Consumes 1 Bomb or Cannonball upon use; may use other types of Bombs or Cannonballs for additional effects. Heavy Weapons *cannot* use other kinds of ammo.

### Cannonballs

Cannonballs are a special type of ammo, used only by Heavy Weapons. They are weighty metal spheres, the size of a Bomb, no more dangerous than any other object.

Cannonballs can only be created at a Forge, by consuming two pieces of Metal or Ancient Material. This creates a single Cannonball of the Material’s Rank, or (base Smithing / 2) rounded down, whichever is lower.

| Rank   | Damage | Market Price |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Rank 0 | 16     | 20           |
| Rank 1 | 20     | 40           |
| Rank 2 | 24     | 80           |
| Rank 3 | 28     | 160          |
| Rank 4 | 32     | 400          |
| Rank 5 | 40     | 800          |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns .half-width .centered-bold }

Cannonballs do not explode on impact – like Arrows, they strike only one target. Unlike Bombs, Cannonballs *do not* ignore Defense.

### Example

*Torvan, the Zora knight, is atop the parapets of North Castle. A horde of Moblins is approaching the castle walls. Fortunately, the good Sir Torvan is armed with a freshly-hewn catapult (Rank 2, no crafting style), and a pile of bombs and cannonballs.*

*Seeing the Moblins grouped in tight formation, Torvan decides to start things off with a bang. He loads a Bomb into his catapult, and pulls the firing rope.*

*Torvan has an Accuracy of 3, and his catapult (having no crafting style) also has a Weapon Accuracy of 3, so he rolls 2d6 + 6 against a Moblin's Evasion, like with any attack. If it fails, the Bomb might simply go wide, or be a dud – fortunately for Torvan, his aim is true and the Bomb slams into the opposing forces. When it explodes, it does so with more force than usual: the catapult adds 4 damage to the Bomb's usual 8, and that damage still ignores Defense, and still explodes in a Burst 1 around its impact site.*

*As the Moblins scatter, Torvan begins to pick them off one by one. He loads a cannonball into the catapult next, and fires it at one hapless foe. This too lands true, slamming into a lone Moblin. The cannonball, also being Rank 2, has a damage of 24, and the catapult adds 4 to that – meaning the cannonball deals a total of 28 damage, though this is mitigated by Defense.*

Torvan smiles. He can do this all day – but as the Moblins begin to retreat to the hills, he breathes a sigh of relief, glad that he won't have to.*

## Kiosk

Kiosks are small Buildings, about the same size as a closet or a single room. They typically have a door or curtain, and a window that opens to the outside world. They are often used as guardhouses, storage sheds, or waystations on the road.

Kiosks can only hold ((Rank + 1) / 2) persons, (Rank) Items or stacks of Items, and provide (Rank) resistance from weather to all creatures within. However, unlike Houses, they do not have a bed, nor or any place to cook a meal.

## Road

Roads allow travelers to cross open ground quickly, easily, and without getting lost. Roads are wide enough to have ((Rank + 1) x 2) persons, or half as many horses, walking abreast on them at a time.

Roads must be in a relatively straight line (with some leeway for following terrain). A single Road can stretch up to one league (about 3 miles, 5 kilometers, or one hour’s leisurely walk). Creating a path between two distant points may require multiple Roads to cover the full distance.

## Sign

Signs allow individuals to send a message to any who stumble across the sign and read it. They may be useful for giving directions, telling intruders they’re unwelcome, or providing advice to travelers regarding an upcoming obstacle or hazard.

Signs must be visible and legible in order to communicate their message to passers-by. A single Sign can communicate roughly (Rank+1) lines of information or ideas, though this may vary (GM’s discretion) depending on how the information is presented: a written sentence, a short series of coded symbols, or iconography for ‘danger’ or ‘monsters ahead’, would all count as a single line of information or idea.

## Tree (Food-Bearing)

Some trees, like Apple, Banana, and Coconut Trees, provide food on occasion. They also serve as a lovely natural decoration for towns. This Amenity type can be used as the basis for other individual food-bearing plants, such as corn, watermelons, pumpkins, or grapes. (Large fields of food-bearing plants are best simulated as Farms.)

Food-Bearing Trees bear a specific kind of food item, chosen at the Tree’s creation, based on the Food Ingredient used to initially create the tree. Upgrading a Food-Bearing Tree later does not change the Ingredient it bears, but does boost its yield.

The Tree bears food once every seven days, providing ((Rank + 1) / 2) units of its chosen food ingredient. This food ingredient has a Rank of (Rank), and a special property, if any, which matches the original food item used to first create the Tree.

## Wagon

Wagons are wooden carts used to transport large amounts of goods between settlements or over long distances. Heroes may want to use a Wagon to move piles of treasure found in dungeons and caverns, taking them back to town for sale or trade.

When a Wagon is built, select one of Land, Sea, or Air. The Wagon is built for that particular kind of terrain. Sea-wagons might be dinghies, or the shells of giant turtles, used by Zora merchants; Air-wagons might be small dirigibles pulled by Loftwings.

If used on other types of terrain – for instance, a sea-wagon being used on land – then it is considered Slowed.

Wagons are heavy, and don’t move on their own. A Wagon requires a total Athletics of ((Rank + 1) x 2) to move. A Wagon may have up to two creatures pulling it.

Wagons can store up to ((Rank + 1) x 5) items or creatures. Each slot of storage acts just like a slot of Overflow Inventory - any kind of item may go into it, and items that stack may stack as large as they like. An individual creature takes up a single slot.

Heroes pulling a Wagon must use both hands to do so. Mounts are hitched to the Wagon, and cannot move without also moving the Wagon. (Hitching or unhitching a Mount to a Wagon takes a few minutes, making it impossible to do during combat.)

## Well

Wells provide fresh, clean water to the populace of a settlement.

Using a Well takes one minute, and provides (Rank + 1) gallons of water per use. The bucket is secured to the well, but can be emptied into other buckets, bottles, or any other watertight containers.
