    "title": "Heavy Weapon",
    "content": "Heavy Weapons are used by armies when fighting against, or from, fortified positions. These weighty Large-sized devices might be cannons, catapults, or trebuchets, depending on the tech level of your game world. Too large and heavy for a single Hero to carry, they are powerful, stationary weapons. Heavy Weapons require (Rank x 2) base Smithing to craft. Heavy Weapons require one hand to be firedor loaded. They can be pushed with two hands, as if the mover(s) were Slowed (except on Roads, which allow full speed). They can’t be rolled over Difficult Terrain, but can be carried – requiring four hands total. Multiple Heroes may work together to provide the necessary number of hands for an action – for instance, two Heroes could roll a cannon down a road with one hand each, moving on the slower Hero’s turn. Heavy Weapons cannot fire and be moved in the same round. Once fired, they cannot move; once moved, they cannot be fired. Heavy Weapons use Bombs or Cannonballs as ammunition. Loading a Heavy Weapon is a Minor action, and firing it uses the “Launch Shell” Basic Attack. Heavy Weapons lose Durability with use, as any Weapon would. Heavy Weapons can be made in a Crafting Style and Enchanted, as a Ranged Weapon. The higher the Rank of the Heavy Weapon used to fire a Bomb or Cannonball, the more damage it deals and the further it can fly. Heavy Weapons have an Accuracy of 3. Crafting Styles can reduce their Attack below 1 (or make it negative!). | Rank | ATK | DUR | Range | . | Rank 0 | 0 | 3 | 10 sq. | . | Rank 1 | 2 | 6 | 15 sq. | . | Rank 2 | 4 | 9 | 20 sq. | . | Rank 3 | 6 | 12 | 25 sq. | . | Rank 4 | 8 | 15 | 30 sq. | . | Rank 5 | 10 | 20 | 40 sq. | . Basic Attack: Launch Shell . This Basic Attack can only be used with a Heavy Weapon. Unlike most Basic Attacks, this one does not take advantage of the user’s Combat or Willpower – the damage is up to the Heavy Weapon and its ammunition. Remember that this is a Projectile attack; as such, if any foe is adjacent to you, then all foes are Hard to Hit with a Heavy Weapon. When a Bomb is fired from a Heavy Weapon, it explodes immediately upon impact. If your attack misses, the Bomb has no effect. Step-Mines, Bombchu, and Powder Kegs cannot be fired from Heavy Weapons. Requires: Heavy Weapon Range: Projectile, Heavy Weapon’s range (see above) Damage: Heavy Weapon + Ammunition Effect: Consumes 1 Bomb or Cannonball upon use; may use other types of Bombs or Cannonballs for additional effects. Heavy Weapons cannot use other kinds of ammo. Cannonballs . Cannonballs are a special type of ammo, used only by Heavy Weapons. They are weighty metal spheres, the size of a Bomb, no more dangerous than any other object. Cannonballs can only be created at a Forge, by consuming two pieces of Metal or Ancient Material. This creates a single Cannonball of the Material’s Rank, or (base Smithing / 2) rounded down, whichever is lower. | Rank | Damage | Market Price | . | Rank 0 | 16 | 20 | . | Rank 1 | 20 | 40 | . | Rank 2 | 24 | 80 | . | Rank 3 | 28 | 160 | . | Rank 4 | 32 | 400 | . | Rank 5 | 40 | 800 | . Cannonballs do not explode on impact – like Arrows, they strike only one target. Unlike Bombs, Cannonballs do not ignore Defense. Example . Torvan, the Zora knight, is atop the parapets of North Castle. A horde of Moblins is approaching the castle walls. Fortunately, the good Sir Torvan is armed with a freshly-hewn catapult (Rank 2, no crafting style), and a pile of bombs and cannonballs. Seeing the Moblins grouped in tight formation, Torvan decides to start things off with a bang. He loads a Bomb into his catapult, and pulls the firing rope. Torvan has an Accuracy of 3, and his catapult (having no crafting style) also has a Weapon Accuracy of 3, so he rolls 2d6 + 6 against a Moblin’s Evasion, like with any attack. If it fails, the Bomb might simply go wide, or be a dud – fortunately for Torvan, his aim is true and the Bomb slams into the opposing forces. When it explodes, it does so with more force than usual: the catapult adds 4 damage to the Bomb’s usual 8, and that damage still ignores Defense, and still explodes in a Burst 1 around its impact site. As the Moblins scatter, Torvan begins to pick them off one by one. He loads a cannonball into the catapult next, and fires it at one hapless foe. This too lands true, slamming into a lone Moblin. The cannonball, also being Rank 2, has a damage of 24, and the catapult adds 4 to that – meaning the cannonball deals a total of 28 damage, though this is mitigated by Defense. Torvan smiles. He can do this all day – but as the Moblins begin to retreat to the hills, he breathes a sigh of relief, glad that he won’t have to.* . ",

Barracks allow the members of a community to organize guards or a militia, giving them an armed force to defend their settlement, patrol for lawbreakers, or respond to crises. Barracks are staffed with ((Rank + 1) x 10) Guards. These Guards are built out as Villagers, meaning that they start with 40 Tokens to spend, and all Traits start at 1. They have an extra (Rank x 20) Tokens of Heroism to spend. Guards cannot increase a Trait above (4 + (Rank / 2)), cannot purchase any Feats, Techniques, or Skills that cost more than (4 + Rank) Tokens, and cannot purchase any Crafting Style Feats. Guards are usually, but not necessarily, of a Race that would commonly be found in the Barracks’ settlement. Guards have all the benefits and the Vulnerability of their Race. Guards may be seen performing the following duties (among others!), as time and circumstance permit: . Patrol the settlement, keeping the peace and responding to crime. Patrol roads to and from the settlement, searching for bandits and monsters that might cause trouble to travelers. Stand guard at specific locations important to the settlement. These might be the town gates, the office of an important official, a high-value Building, or the site of recent criminal or monster activity. Stand watch at the village outskirts. This allows Guards to look out for trouble on the horizon - advancing armies, fleeing criminals, or even the weather. If the settlement has Walls or Towers, the Guards may use those structures for this purpose. Ceremonial duties, such as marching in parades, serving in coronations, and adding gravitas to state funerals. Guards are assigned Weapons and Armor from the Barracks, as per the table below. | Rank | Guard Tokens | Head | Chest | Legs | Weapon 1 | Weapon 2 | . | Rank 0 | 40 | - | Rank 0 | Rank 0 | Rank 0 | - | . | Rank 1 | 60 | - | Rank 1 | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 0 | . | Rank 2 | 80 | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 1 | Rank 1 | Rank 0 | . | Rank 3 | 100 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 1 | . | Rank 4 | 120 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 2 | Rank 2 | Rank 2 | . | Rank 5 | 140 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 3 | . Guards generally do not carry Tools, but if their duties require the use of one, they may substitute one of their Weapons for Mundane or Miscellaneous Tools of equal value. A Guard’s exact equipment loadout (including the Style and type of Weapon they use) may depend on their personality, the town they are stationed in, and the local availability of equipment, smiths, or materials. A piece of a guard’s Equipment may be Enchanted. They may have up to (Rank / 2) pieces of equipment enchanted, with the Enchantment Rank matching the item’s Rank. The type of Enchantment may be limited by local availability of Gems. In general, all Guards stationed at a Barracks are built out the same way: same Traits, Equipment, Feats, Techniques, and Spells. There may be exceptions, however, as game and plot require. Guards stationed at two different Barracks in the same city will likely be built differently, however. Typically, Barracks and their Guards are too busy with their duties to accompany Heroes on their adventures, and are generally ill-equipped to match a Hero’s skill and power. However, if a Hero has proven themselves a friend of the Guards, then the Guards may deign to return the favor: with their presence, or with information they’ve gleaned while performing their duties. The Owner of a Barracks may request a Guard accompany them as a Companion, and they do not need to further pay them for this service. Abusing this right - such as by allowing the Guard to die or unduly suffer while in their service - may have negative consequences for them. Owners of a Barracks are also the first to hear about whatever troubles the Guards of the Barracks may be dealing with of late, which may lead to additional quests and adventures. ",

When they do this, the Owner receives a small amount of Rupees per day based on the Rank of the House, much as if it were a For-Profit Shop or other Building. However, an Owner cannot then use a rented-out House for their own purposes, including as a place to rest. If a House’s Owner does not rent out the house, they may use it for themselves; this is a Non-Profit use. This allows them to fill it with their own belongings, customize its colors and furnishings, and to rest there for free. When resting in a House, Heroes restore all of their Burnt and Spent Health, Magic, and Stamina, as well as gaining Temporary HP based on the Rank of the House. Houses include a reasonable suite of furniture to fill the space - so a House always includes a bed, table, chairs, and so on. A House’s owners are free to obtain and use their own furniture, as well. All Houses contain a kitchen, which includes a Cooking Fixture and a place to have a fire. This means that residents in a House can use it to cook without further expenditure. Houses do not come equipped with a Forge, however. Houses can store up to (Rank x 4) items per Hero. Each slot of storage acts just like a slot of Overflow Inventory - any kind of item may go into it, and items that stack may stack as large as they like. Be cautious of storing a large number of valuable items or materials in your home - Houses are easier to break into, and are generally less well-guarded, than a Bank of equal rank. Further, the more valuable the goods in the home, the more likely it is that thieves will strike, breaking in while any resident Heroes are away and looting the place. If you have a large number of valuable objects you wish to store for a long time, buying space at a Bank may be a better, safer option. Finally, resting in a House provides a small amount of Temporary HP, as per the table below. Resting in a House provides no Temporary MP or Temporary SP. | HouseRank | Temp HPon Rest | Item StorageSlots (per Hero) | . | Rank 0 | 0 | 0 | . | Rank 1 | 2 | 4 | . | Rank 2 | 4 | 8 | . | Rank 3 | 6 | 12 | . | Rank 4 | 8 | 16 | . | Rank 5 | 10 | 20 | . Renting a House . Sometimes, Heroes may be staying in an area long enough that they won’t want to stay in an Inn room, but will not be staying long enough (or may not be rich enough) to outright buy or build their own House. In this case, they can choose to rent a House that someone else owns. The cost of renting is the same as the profits the Owner of a House would make per day. Houses must be rented for a minimum of 5 days at a time, and are rented in increments of 5 days thereafter - so Inn rooms are more efficient if you intend to spend only a night or two in town, or if you need to leave at a moment’s notice. Not every community will have Houses for rent - it’s not a guarantee, especially in smaller communities where there are few travelers and no real estate market. ",

If Heroes are unsure of what to do next, are in need of some work for a little extra money, could use an extra hand, or want to hear local rumors, they should hang around the Inn – and the GM should take this as a sign to throw them a bone, and provide a short, low-stakes adventure for them to partake in.

Ports serve as places to book passage on vehicles, allowing Heroes to travel farther and faster than they might otherwise be able to – but only to those places that captains are willing to take them. The Rank of a Port dictates the kinds of destinations that a Hero can book passage to. The more distant or difficult the journey, the more expensive the fare. The purchase of a fare covers an entire party of Heroes, anything they can carry, and any Companions in tow. If sending goods in bulk, a single fare can hold up to (fare’s Rank x 10) slots of items, much like a Bank. Typically, one can only book passage to other civilized places that have their own Ports, though exceptions might be made by brave or foolhardy captains (or Heroes willing to throw more Rupees around).

In addition, should a Hero happen to own a proper vehicle, they can register them at the Port, for 100 Rupees. Once registered, the Port’s personnel will mind the vehicle and keep watch over it, allowing the Hero to venture off knowing that their conveyance will be properly cared for. This registration is a one-time fee, no matter how many Ports a Hero might visit with their vehicle. Heroes may use a Port to freely summon a vehicle housed at a different Port, in order to make use of it - in some games, the vehicle in question may have to physically traverse the distance themselves, while in others, Ports can instantly transport vehicles through the power of magic. Traditionally, Ports are focused on water-faring vessels, and thus can only be built in places with significant water access (such as on the edge of a lake, on the ocean shore, or along a large river). In some games, however, there may be air-ports servicing dirigibles or jet-planes, travel\u0002centers that offer public transit over land routes, or space-ports to service rockets and starships.

Shops that sell Materials – meaning Jewelers, Lumber Yards, Masons, Refineries, Scrapyards, Seamstresses, and Taxidermists – sell Materials of up to their Rank. For example, a Rank 3 Lumber Yard can sell Rank 0, 1, 2, or 3 Wood Materials. Hardware Stores sell all types of Mundane and Miscellaneous Tools, of up to their Rank. For instance, a Rank 3 Hardware Store can sell Rank 0, 1, 2, or 3 Shovels. Armories, Arsenals, and Fashion Boutiques sell all Armor, Weapons, or Clothing (respectively). The items on offer are of a Rank up to the Building’s Rank. Arsenals typically offer their Weapons in only a single Crafting Style (if any), though the right Employee may allow them to source a second Style. Armories, Arsenals, and Fashion Boutiques also keep (Rank) many unique, already-enchanted, one-off items behind the counter, of a Rank up to (but not always equal to!) the Shop’s Rank. These items may have some history to them, but they’re always one-offs, and are almost certain to be sold to someone else if the Heroes do not snatch them up today. Alchemists, Witches, and Restaurants offer a limited selection of pre-made consumables. They offer ((2 x Rank) + 1) different kinds of items, of a Rank up to the Shop’s Rank. Restaurants offer Dishes, while Alchemists and Witches offer Elixirs.

Farmer’s Markets and Breeders function a little differently than other Shops that sell Materials. Their selection is based on the different foods or creatures that they have access to – typically, those found locally. Each offers ((2 x Rank) + 1) different kinds of Materials, each of a Rank up to (but not necessarily equal to) the Building’s Rank. General Stores sell a little bit of everything - literally. Their wares are more varied, and their stock more limited, than any other shop type.

Further, Heroes may use a Stable to freely summon a Mount or Companion residing at a different Stable, in order to make use of them - in some games, the Mount or Companion in question may have to physically traverse the distance themselves, while in others, Stables can instantly transport Companions and Mounts through the power of magic. In addition, Stables provide any stabled Mounts and Companions with temporary HP, based on the quality of the Building, when the Companion is stabled at the Building for an Extended Rest. | Building Rank | Temp HP | . | Rank 0 | 0 | . | Rank 1 | 4 | . | Rank 2 | 8 | . | Rank 3 | 12 | . | Rank 4 | 16 | . | Rank 5 | 20 | .

Your settlement is now a player on the world stage, able to stand toe-to-toe with the likes of Hyrule and other great nations. The presence of the Castle, as the seat of power, brings traders, money, and people in positions of power from all over the kingdom and beyond. In addition to the money a Castle (and the government within it) brings, the Castle also offers protection in times of great strife. When a city is invaded or besieged, its people may retreat within the confines of the Castle, allowing it to serve as a final line of defense in the face of a siege. While a Castle is full of people fleeing war, it offers no benefits to its Owners – the many huddled, stressed civilians make it impossible for everyday business to be conducted. … for the Owner . Castles offer their owner the benefits of a wide variety of Buildings and Amenities, all under one roof – and the Owner’s control. All Buildings in a Castle are of the same Rank as the Castle. They do not directly contribute to the Owner’s coffers, however – that amount is included in the money a Castle brings in regularly. Barracks: A Castle is staffed with servants, as well as a small cohort of personal guards. These guards are sworn to serve the Castle Owners, and to protect them at any cost. Commons: A Castle’s immaculate gardens and easily-seen balconies serve as the perfect place for the Castle’s Owner to make proclamations and give speeches. Cooking Fixture &amp; Forge: A Castle features a Cooking Fixture and a Forge, allowing Owners to dabble in whatever crafts they enjoy. House: A Castle contains a set of private chambers, exclusively for the use of the Castle’s Owners and their guests. This House cannot be rented out. Office: A Castle contains a number of rooms that enable its Owner to coordinate their investments, collect taxes, and otherwise ensure that their money continues to grow. Stables: A Castle contains a set of Stables. This allows the Owner’s mounts to be ready and available in moments. Tower: A Castle is not complete without a tower to dominate the skyline, and provide a view of the countryside to the inhabitants. Walls: A Castle is surrounded by Walls. These serve to keep out both the common riffraff, and to protect the inhabitants (and any refugees) from besieging forces. Well: Castles typically include at least one Well, granting their Owners (and those who work for them) easy access to fresh water. Patronage . A Castle’s Owners, befitting their wealth and status in the community, can become Patrons of existing Buildings and Amenities. You can be a Patron to (Castle Rank) different Buildings or Amenities. You can only become a Patron of a Building or Amenity ofyour Castle’s Rank, or lower. Becoming a Patron of a Building or Amenity means that you throw the weight of your name behind it. The Building’s Owner might drop your name in conversations and negotiations, and will be sure to mention to customers that this is where you choose to spend your time. An Amenity you patronize might feature a plaque dedicating it to you, or a statue of your visage in the middle of it, ensuring your name is remembered. Of course, becoming a Patron of a Building has benefits for you, as well. As a Patron of a Building, you have all the benefits of ownership of that Building, except the Rupee per-diem that an Owner would expect. For example, if you became Patron of a Bank, your available storage space at that Bank would double; if you became Patron of a Post Office, you would occasionally receive packages from the lost-and-found. In addition, becoming a Patron of a Building ensures its Employees always have time to see you, and that they serve you first and foremost even when things are busy and crowded. You might also hear any rumors or news they receive, before anyone else. If the Building is a Shop of some kind, then they might save the occasional weird, powerful, or dangerous item for their Patrons, giving them ‘first dibs’ on rare or unique goods. However, just because they’re saving an item for you, doesn’t mean they’ll cut you a sweetheart deal on it. Other benefits of becoming a Patron may vary for each Building, community, or Owner. When becoming a Patron of a Building, speak with your GM, and work out what benefits might behoove your generosity! . ",

Note that claiming a Title (or Building a Castle at all), when your betters have not granted you explicit permission to do so, may result in unpleasantness – or even war! . | Castle Rank | Castle Market Price | Profits for Owner / Day | Possible Titles | . | Rank 0 | 2500 | 50 | Chieftan, Slumlord, Yeoman | . | Rank 1 | 5000 | 100 | Esquire, Lord, Mayor, Sahib | . | Rank 2 | 10000 | 200 | Baron, Knight, Rais, Viscount | . | Rank 3 | 20000 | 400 | Count, Duke, Emir, Marquis | . | Rank 4 | 50000 | 1000 | King, Princess, Raj, Sultan | . | Rank 5 | 100000 | 2000 | Emperor, High King, Kaiser | .

    "title": "Your Personal Touch",
    "content": "The mightier a Castle is, the more powerful its Owners’ personal touch is. A Castle’s Owners may, upon construction, put up to (Rank) Personal Touches on the Castle. This Personal Touch puts extra resources and attention towards that part of the Castle, improving it, and its effects, to the utmost. Each Personal Touch can only be taken once, but multiple Personal Touches can affect the same part of the Castle. For instance, you may have a Multitudinous Garrison and a Royal Guard, granting you an impressive personal army. Beginning on the next page is a small list of Personal Touches that can be applied to your Castle. GMs and Heroes looking for new ways to personalize their ultimate abode are encouraged to come up with new ones! . Additional Patronage . Rather than spending your time on your Castle, you’re spending it in the community. You become the Patron of one additional Building. Bunker-Built . When the Castle is used to house a large population (such as during a siege), normal operations continue, and the Castle’s Owners may continue to make use of the Castle’s amenities. Comfortable Chambers . Resting in the Castle grants its Owners Temporary MP and SP, as well as Temporary HP, like resting at an Inn of the Castle’s Rank. Formidable Fortress . Double the Defense and the HP of the Walls of the Castle. Multitudinous Garrison . Double the number of soldiers in the Castle’s Barracks. Powerful Pulpit . Double the Trait Check bonus for speaking to an assembled crowd at the Castle’s Commons. Profitable Palace . Increase the amount of Rupees the Castle brings in by 25%. This Personal Touch can be taken multiple times, stacking cumulatively (so 25%, 50%, 75%, up to the maximum of +125%). Royal Guard . +1 to the Rank of all equipment used by all soldiers in the Castle. Secret Escape . In case of insurrection, the Castle features one or more secret escape paths. These paths lead out of the Castle, and exit a significant distance away (no more than a day’s travel overland). Only the Castle’s Owners know how to reveal these paths, where they begin, and where they go. Stupendous Stable . Companions who rest in the Castle gain Temporary MP and SP, as well as Temporary HP, like resting at a Stable of the Castle’s Rank. The Tallest Tower . Double the height of the Castle’s Tower. If your game world has significant infrastructure in the sky (such as a Sky Kingdom or airship travel), the Castle now has direct access to that infrastructure. Wards of Privacy . The Castle stonework is enchanted to prevent magical access. Songs such as Farore’s Wind, Song of Discovery, and any other means of scrying, remote viewing, or teleportation, fail to work so long as the Castle’s walls are all still standing. You may designate exceptions to these wards as you see fit, such as letting trusted advisors bypass them, or allowing those who know your Royal Password Song through. ",

    "content": "As the proud owner of a new Castle, you are entitled to one further benefit: you can now Compose the “Royal Password” Magical Song. This Magical Song represents your family, adventuring party, or whatever you consider those closest to you, and only they may play it. Once per Extended Rest, while in a place you currently own (that no one else can stake a claim to), you may permanently seal an object by playing your Royal Password. With a Rank 0 Castle, you may only seal messages, hiding them from view. With a Rank 2 Castle, you may seal or hide doors, chests, or other objects. Finally, with a Rank 4 Castle, you may seal complex mechanisms. Once sealed, the object will activate (or de-activate) whenever it hears your Royal Password . ",

    "doc": "Villages, Towns, and Cities",
    "title": "Villages, Towns, and Cities",
    "content": "Settlements can be broken down into three categories: Villages, Towns, and Cities. Villages are the smallest category of settlement, typically only featuring a few small Buildings, and anywhere from just one resident to a hundred (though typically measuring in the dozens). Villages have few resources to their name, and most people living in a Village are focused on day-to-day survival, lacking the time for leisure. If a Village has a leader, it is most often just the oldest or most respected person in the group, and is rarely an official position. Because Villages typically lack any kind of walls, militia, or defenses, a Hero or a band of monsters might ride past one and not even realize it’s there - but if they do notice, the Village is surely in trouble. Villages always contain at least one Farm, and at least one House. They also have at least one service, typically a single Shop, a Stable, or a Workshop. Towns are the middling category of settlement, and may be the most common. They typically range from having a hundred residents, up to a thousand. They feature a recognizable market square or street, and often have actual roads leading to and from points of interest. Villages have enough people, resources, and time to have many classes of people: farmers, merchants, and tradesmen can all coexist and help one another. Towns often have a recognized leader, often an elected official with a small office to befit their title. Towns will sometimes have walls, if they are in a dangerous or oft\u0002contested location; they can also call on their citizens to mobilize, creating a crude militia in times of crisis. Towns feature all that Villages do, as well as at least one Inn, and at least three Shops (though they often have more than that). Towns also feature at least three of the following: a Cultural Monument, Enchanter, Healer, Post Office, Stable, and/or a Workshop. Some Towns may have Walls. Cities are the largest category of settlement, and are rare - a kingdom may not have any true cities, or it might have up to a handful if in the midst of a golden age. Cities have thousands of people in them, from all walks of life and all trades, making them a great place to look if you’re seeking something rare or esoteric. Cities have a thriving bureaucracy with many departments and officials; some are elected, others are merit-based, and yet others might be appointed by royal decree. Cities quite often have walls, checkpoints, and other defenses, making them difficult for enemies to assail directly. Cities feature everything that a Town has, and can further have just about any type of Building that you can imagine within their bounds. Cities must have at least five kinds of Shops, though they often have many more. They also feature at least six of the following: a Bank, Cultural Monument, Enchanter, Healer, a Library or Book Store, a Minigame, an Observatory or Fortune Teller, Post Office, a Restaurant, Stable, Tower, or a Workshop. Most Cities have Walls, as well. ",
