Banks can provide up to (Rank x 10) slots of Storage per person. (This means a Rank 0 Bank can’t store any items!)</p> <p>Each slot of Storage acts just like a slot of Overflow Inventory - any kind of item may go into it, and items that stack may stack as large as they like.</p> <p>A Bank’s Owners have their available item storage at the Bank doubled: for example, if they have purchased 3 slots, then they have 6 available. These bonus slots do not count towards the Owners’ limit of up to (Rank x 10) Storage slots per person. If the Owners lose possession of the Bank, they can no longer place items in these bonus slots, but can still remove them at their leisure.<br> Banks can also store your Rupees, to prevent them from being stolen by cutpursesor eaten by Like-Likes.</p> <p>Storing your Rupees costs nothing, and you do not need to purchase or use a Storage slot for them. You may withdraw your Rupees or your items whenever you visit the Bank in person. You may also withdraw items and Rupees from the Bank whenever you communicate with them, such as by mail - so long as you’re willing to deal with the time it takes for the post to deliver.</p> <p>Rupees stored at a Bank do <em>not</em> accrue interest.</p> <h2 id="barracks"> <a href="#barracks" aria-labelledby="barracks" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Barracks </h2> <p><em>Non-Profit</em></p> <p>Barracks allow the members of a community to organize guards or a militia, giving them an armed force to defend their settlement, patrol for lawbreakers, or respond to crises.</p> <p>Barracks are staffed with ((Rank + 1) x 10) Guards. These Guards are built out as Villagers, meaning that they start with 40 Tokens to spend, and all Traits start at 1. They have an extra (Rank x 20) Tokens of Heroism to spend. Guards cannot increase a Trait above (4 + (Rank / 2)), cannot purchase any Feats, Techniques, or Skills that cost more than (4 + Rank) Tokens, and cannot purchase any Crafting Style Feats.</p> <p>Guards are usually, but not necessarily, of a Race that would commonly be found in the Barracks’ settlement. Guards have all the benefits and the Vulnerability of their Race.</p> <p>Guards may be seen performing the following duties (among others!), as time and circumstance permit:</p> <p><strong>Patrol the settlement,</strong> keeping the peace and responding to crime.</p> <p><strong>Patrol roads</strong> to and from the settlement, searching for bandits and monsters that might cause trouble to travelers.</p> <p><strong>Stand guard at specific locations</strong> important to the settlement. These might be the town gates, the office of an important official, a high-value Building, or the site of recent criminal or monster activity.</p> <p><strong>Stand watch</strong> at the village outskirts. This allows Guards to look out for trouble on the horizon - advancing armies, fleeing criminals, or even the weather. If the settlement has Walls or Towers, the Guards may use those structures for this purpose.</p> <p><strong>Ceremonial duties,</strong> such as marching in parades, serving in coronations, and adding gravitas to state funerals.</p> <p>Guards are assigned Weapons and Armor from the Barracks, as per the table below.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="rtw-table fixed-columns-100 centered-bold"> <thead> <tr> <th>Rank</th> <th>Guard Tokens</th> <th>Head</th> <th>Chest</th> <th>Legs</th> <th>Weapon 1</th> <th>Weapon 2</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>40</td> <td>-</td> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>-</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>60</td> <td>-</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>80</td> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 3</td> <td>100</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Rank 1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 4</td> <td>120</td> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Rank 2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 5</td> <td>140</td> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Rank 3</td> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Rank 3</td> <td>Rank 3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>Guards generally do not carry Tools, but if their duties require the use of one, they may substitute one of their Weapons for Mundane or Miscellaneous Tools of equal value.</p> <p>A Guard’s exact equipment loadout (including the Style and type of Weapon they use) may depend on their personality, the town they are stationed in, and the local availability of equipment, smiths, or materials.</p> <p>A piece of a guard’s Equipment may be Enchanted. They may have up to (Rank / 2) pieces of equipment enchanted, with the Enchantment Rank matching the item’s Rank. The type of Enchantment may be limited by local availability of Gems.</p> <p>In general, all Guards stationed at a Barracks are built out the same way: same Traits, Equipment, Feats, Techniques, and Spells. There may be exceptions, however, as game and plot require. Guards stationed at two different Barracks in the same city will likely be built differently, however.</p> <p>Typically, Barracks and their Guards are too busy with their duties to accompany Heroes on their adventures, and are generally ill-equipped to match a Hero’s skill and power. However, if a Hero has proven themselves a friend of the Guards, then the Guards may deign to return the favor: with their presence, or with information they’ve gleaned while performing their duties.</p> <p>The Owner of a Barracks may request a Guard accompany them as a Companion, and they do not need to further pay them for this service. Abusing this right - such as by allowing the Guard to die or unduly suffer while in their service - may have negative consequences for them. Owners of a Barracks are also the first to hear about whatever troubles the Guards of the Barracks may be dealing with of late, which may lead to additional quests and adventures.</p> <h2 id="cooking-co-op"> <a href="#cooking-co-op" aria-labelledby="cooking-co-op" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Cooking Co-Op </h2> <p><em>For-Profit</em></p> <p>Cooking Co-Ops are communal kitchens, where community members can come together to share ingredients, recipes, and gossip. Some Cooking Co-Ops also do charity work by providing Food Ingredients or hot meals to those who need a little help.</p> <p>Cooking Co-Ops provide a number of services to Heroes who visit them.</p> <p>First, all Cooking Co-Ops include a Cooking Fixture. Heroes may make use of a Cooking Co-Op’s Cooking Fixture for their own purposes at no charge, so long as they are on good terms with the Co-Op.</p> <p>Second, Heroes can pay a Cooking Co-Op to make a Dish for them, using Ingredients that the Heroes provide.

By bringing (6 – Rank) Food Ingredients and donating them to the Co-Op, the Hero may then leave with one Food Ingredient of their choice, of a Rank equal to the lowest-ranked Ingredient they donated (or the Building’s Rank, whichever is lower).</p> <p>A Co-Op’s available Ingredients is limited by their biome, and may be further limited by what’s at market, what others have brought in, or other factors.</p> <p>Finally, Heroes can spend time helping out in the Co-Op’s kitchens, entertaining visitors, or delivering meals to people in need. This counts as doing an Odd Job, and may earn the Hero some spare Rupees (or some Ingredients of equivalent market price, of up to the Building’s Rank).</p> <p>For their Owners, Cooking Co-Ops provide one Food Ingredient, of a Rank up to the Building’s Rank, per day. This Ingredient might be close to its expiry date, and might vary with whatever the Co-Op has been able to stock of late.</p> <h2 id="cultural-monuments"> <a href="#cultural-monuments" aria-labelledby="cultural-monuments" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Cultural Monuments </h2> <p><em>Non-Profit</em></p> <p>Cultural Monuments are a special kind of Building - they make no profits on their own, but they enhance the culture and prosperity of the community around them. Museums, Obelisks, Statues, and Temples are all examples of kinds of Cultural Monuments. Sites of historical importance, such as old battlegrounds or tombs of important historical figures, might also be built up and turned into Cultural Monuments. As public works of culture, they are of course Non-Profit.</p> <p>Cultural Monuments provide a Profit Bonus to For-Profit Buildings that are adjacent to them, based on the Rank of the Statue.</p> <p>A single Cultural Monument can only be adjacent to (and thus, can only benefit) up to 8 Buildings.</p> <p>Cultural Monuments may be built within a Commons, providing the benefits of both in a single area.</p> <p>Cultural Monuments may also provide other benefits to the community, such as prestige for the artisan who built them, or increased tourism in the area.</p> <h2 id="cultural-wonder"> <a href="#cultural-wonder" aria-labelledby="cultural-wonder" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Cultural Wonder </h2> <p><em>Non-Profit</em></p> <p>A Cultural Wonder is a special kind of Cultural Monument. It represents the power, wisdom, or courage of the entire community, and can draw admirers from all the world.</p> <p>A Cultural Wonder can be built like any Cultural Monument, but costs 5 times the Materials in each category and takes 5 times the duration to construct, deconstruct, upgrade, and downgrade. Cultural Wonders tend to be quite massive: temples that can be mistaken for mountains, a statue of a goddess at full scale, or a network of catacombs the size of a city. Also like a Cultural Monument, these are public works and are therefore Non-Profit.</p> <p>Once built, a Cultural Wonder provides three Profit Boosts (of the Wonder’s Rank) to any For-Profit Buildings that are directly adjacent to it. All non-adjacent For-Profit Buildings in the community gain a single Profit Boost (of the Wonder’s Rank).</p> <h2 id="enchanter"> <a href="#enchanter" aria-labelledby="enchanter" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Enchanter </h2> <p><em>For-Profit</em></p> <p>Enchanters can enchant weapons and armor, or transmute Materials, for a price.</p> <p>Enchanters can perform Enchantments or Transmutations with a required Enchanting Trait Rank of (Building Rank x2) or lower.</p> <p>Enchanters do not provide the Gems necessary for Enchantment: you must bring your own Gems for the Enchanter to use.

Both types of Farm provide their Ingredients to the community. Among Food-producing Farms, those that specialize in fruits are “Orchards”, those that raise fish are “Fisheries”, and those that specialize in game are “Reserves”; all of them operate in the same fashion, however.</p> <p>Most farms specialize in a certain type of plant or animal that they tend to - some food farms may grow wheat, others rear cattle or pigs, and some grow fruits or vegetables.</p> <p>A Farm’s crops are determined upon creation, limited to what Ingredients or Critters would thrive in the farm’s biome. (This is typically based on the “Listings by Habitat” found in the Appendices of the Core Rulebook, but your game may have other Critters or Food Ingredients in your biome.)</p> <p>A Farm produces (Rank+1) different types of Food or Critter Ingredient, of a Rank up to the Farm’s Rank. Thus, a Rank 3 Food Farm could sell four different kinds of Rank 3 or lower Food Materials; a Rank 2 Critter Farm could sell three different kinds of Rank 2 or lower Critters.</p> <p>A Farm will sell its wares to anyone who comes by, weather permitting. Farmhands might also deliver the goods to market on certain days, or sell their goods on the side of a well-traveled road near the Farm.</p> <p>For their Owners, Farms provide 5 units ofeither Food Ingredients or Critters, of a Rank up to the Building’s Rank, and of types that the farm produces, per day.</p> <h2 id="garage"> <a href="#garage" aria-labelledby="garage" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Garage </h2> <p><em>For-Profit</em></p> <p>Garages allow mechanically-minded people to come together to work on large, complex projects.

When they do this, the Owner receives a small amount of Rupees per day based on the Rank of the House, much as if it were a For-Profit Shop or other Building. However, an Owner cannot then use a rented-out House for their own purposes, including as a place to rest.</p> <p>If a House’s Owner does <em>not</em> rent out the house, they may use it for themselves; this is a Non-Profit use. This allows them to fill it with their own belongings, customize its colors and furnishings, and to rest there for free. When resting in a House, Heroes restore all of their Burnt and Spent Health, Magic, and Stamina, as well as gaining Temporary HP based on the Rank of the House.</p> <p>Houses include a reasonable suite of furniture to fill the space - so a House always includes a bed, table, chairs, and so on. A House’s owners are free to obtain and use their own furniture, as well.</p> <p>All Houses contain a kitchen, which includes a Cooking Fixture and a place to have a fire. This means that residents in a House can use it to cook without further expenditure. Houses do <em>not</em> come equipped with a Forge, however.</p> <p>Houses can store up to (Rank x 4) items <em>per Hero</em>. Each slot of storage acts just like a slot of Overflow Inventory - any kind of item may go into it, and items that stack may stack as large as they like.</p> <p>Be cautious of storing a large number of valuable items or materials in your home - Houses are easier to break into, and are generally less well-guarded, than a Bank of equal rank. Further, the more valuable the goods in the home, the more likely it is that thieves will strike, breaking in while any resident Heroes are away and looting the place. If you have a large number of valuable objects you wish to store for a long time, buying space at a Bank may be a better, safer option.</p> <p>Finally, resting in a House provides a small amount of Temporary HP, as per the table below. Resting in a House provides no Temporary MP or Temporary SP.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="rtw-table centered-bold half-width"> <thead> <tr> <th>House<br>Rank</th> <th>Temp HP<br>on Rest</th> <th>Item Storage<br>Slots (per Hero)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>2</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>4</td> <td>8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 3</td> <td>6</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 4</td> <td>8</td> <td>16</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 5</td> <td>10</td> <td>20</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <h3 id="renting-a-house"> <a href="#renting-a-house" aria-labelledby="renting-a-house" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Renting a House </h3> <p>Sometimes, Heroes may be staying in an area long enough that they won’t want to stay in an Inn room, but will not be staying long enough (or may not be rich enough) to outright buy or build their own House.

Neither Libraries nor Book Stores sell Empty Books or Ink &amp; Quill sets; to purchase those, visit (or build!) a Tool Shop with the appropriate wares.</p> <p>Book Stores sell their Books directly.

Heroes are unable to borrow books from a Library while they have an outstanding late fee. If they fail to return a valuable enough Book for a long enough time, some Libraries may decide to take more drastic measures to regain their property.</p> <p>A Library’s or Book Store’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Building.

This registration is a one-time fee, no matter how many Ports a Hero might visit with their vehicle.</p> <p>Heroes may use a Port to freely summon a vehicle housed at a different Port, in order to make use of it - in some games, the vehicle in question may have to physically traverse the distance themselves, while in others, Ports can instantly transport vehicles through the power of magic.</p> <p>Traditionally, Ports are focused on water-faring vessels, and thus can only be built in places with significant water access (such as on the edge of a lake, on the ocean shore, or along a large river). In some games, however, there may be air-ports servicing dirigibles or jet-planes, travelcenters that offer public transit over land routes, or space-ports to service rockets and starships.<br> A Port can only service one type of vessel (land, sea, air, space, etc.), chosen when the Port is first constructed.</p> <p>A Port’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Port.

Different kinds of shops sell different kinds of things.</p> <p>Listed below are some of the types of shops that Heroes might find in many cities and towns the world over.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="rtw-table width-70"> <thead> <tr> <th>Shop Type</th> <th>Sells…</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Alchemist or Witch</td> <td>Elixirs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Armorer</td> <td>Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Arsenal or Weapon Shop</td> <td>All Types of Weapons</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bomb Shop</td> <td>Bombs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Breeder</td> <td>Critter Ingredients</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Farmer’s Market</td> <td>Food Ingredients</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fashion Boutique</td> <td>Civilian Clothing (in many styles)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fletcher</td> <td>Arrows</td> </tr> <tr> <td>General Store</td> <td>Anything, but in limited supply</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hardware or Tool Shop</td> <td>Mundane &amp; Miscellaneous Tools</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jeweler</td> <td>Gem Materials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Lumber Yard</td> <td>Wood Materials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mason</td> <td>Stone Materials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Refinery</td> <td>Metal Materials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Restaurant</td> <td>Dishes</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Scrapyard</td> <td>Ancient Materials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Seamstress</td> <td>Cloth Materials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Taxidermist or Hunter</td> <td>Monster Parts</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>Unless otherwise noted, all Shops have enough stock at-hand to satisfy all but the most ludicrous order a Hero could place. This may not be the case if a Shop is suffering in some way, such as from political sanctions, stolen or lost deliveries, or if they’re in a city under siege.</p> <h3 id="what-does-each-shop-sell"> <a href="#what-does-each-shop-sell" aria-labelledby="what-does-each-shop-sell" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What Does Each Shop Sell? </h3> <p><strong>Shops that sell Materials</strong> – meaning Jewelers, Lumber Yards, Masons, Refineries, Scrapyards, Seamstresses, and Taxidermists – sell Materials of up to their Rank. For example, a Rank 3 Lumber Yard can sell Rank 0, 1, 2, or 3 Wood Materials.</p> <p><strong>Hardware Stores</strong> sell all types of Mundane and Miscellaneous Tools, of up to their Rank. For instance, a Rank 3 Hardware Store can sell Rank 0, 1, 2, or 3 Shovels.</p> <p><strong>Armories, Arsenals, and Fashion Boutiques</strong> sell all Armor, Weapons, or Clothing (respectively). The items on offer are of a Rank up to the Building’s Rank. Arsenals typically offer their Weapons in only a single Crafting Style (if any), though the right Employee may allow them to source a second Style.</p> <p>Armories, Arsenals, and Fashion Boutiques also keep (Rank) many unique, already-enchanted, one-off items behind the counter, of a Rank up to (but not always equal to!) the Shop’s Rank. These items may have some history to them, but they’re always one-offs, and are almost certain to be sold to someone else if the Heroes do not snatch them up today.</p> <p><strong>Alchemists, Witches, and Restaurants</strong> offer a limited selection of pre-made consumables. They offer ((2 x Rank) + 1) different kinds of items, of a Rank up to the Shop’s Rank. Restaurants offer Dishes, while Alchemists and Witches offer Elixirs.</p> <p><strong>Fletchers and Bomb Shops</strong> unlock new wares with every Rank, per the table below.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="rtw-table first-small-column centered-first-column"> <thead> <tr> <th>Rank</th> <th>Fletcher</th> <th>Bomb Shop</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>Arrow</td> <td>Bomb</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>Broadhead Arrow, Hammerhead Arrow</td> <td>Firework, Flashbang</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>Bomb Arrow</td> <td>Bombchu, Fireproof Bomb</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 3</td> <td>Showstopper Arrow, Snag Arrow</td> <td>Remote Bomb, Water Bomb</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 4</td> <td>Elemental Arrows (all Elements)</td> <td>Super Bomb, all other Bombs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 5</td> <td>Guardian Arrow, Silver Arrow</td> <td>Powder Keg</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p><strong>Farmer’s Markets and Breeders</strong> function a little differently than other Shops that sell Materials. Their selection is based on the different foods or creatures that they have access to – typically, those found locally. Each offers ((2 x Rank) + 1) different kinds of Materials, each of a Rank up to (but not necessarily equal to) the Building’s Rank.</p> <p><strong>General Stores</strong> sell a little bit of everything - literally. Their wares are more varied, and their stock more limited, than any other shop type. They offer ((Rank + 1) x 4) different individual things, which could be Tools, Weapons, Armor, Materials, Dishes, Elixirs, or nearly anything else.</p> <p>In all cases, however, a General Store’s stock of each item is limited: they will only have one of a Weapon, Armor, or Tool; and only five of a Material, Dish, or Elixir. When the General Store resupplies (roughly every (6 – Rank) days), the available wares may change a little, somewhat, or entirely.</p> <p>Regardless of the type of Shop, a Shop’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the shop. A Shop’s Owners may choose to take their payment in the form of equivalent wares from the Shop’s stock, valued at market price.</p> <h2 id="stables"> <a href="#stables" aria-labelledby="stables" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Stables </h2> <p><em>For-Profit</em></p> <p>Stables allow Heroes to register their Mounts and Companions for 50 Rupees per each Mount or Companion. Mounts and Companions registered at a Stable may reside there for as long as their Hero likes, allowing said Hero to take a different Mount or Companion with them on their journey.<br> This registration is a one-time fee, no matter how many Stables a Hero might visit.</p> <p>Mounts are well-fed and exercised while at a Stable, and Companions will typically find benign ways to occupy their time, either by working at the Stable, or enjoying the surrounding town or countryside.</p> <p>Further, Heroes may use a Stable to freely summon a Mount or Companion residing at a different Stable, in order to make use of them - in some games, the Mount or Companion in question may have to physically traverse the distance themselves, while in others, Stables can instantly transport Companions and Mounts through the power of magic.</p> <p>In addition, Stables provide any stabled Mounts and Companions with temporary HP, based on the quality of the Building, when the Companion is stabled at the Building for an Extended Rest.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="rtw-table centered-bold half-width"> <thead> <tr> <th>Building Rank</th> <th>Temp HP</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Rank 0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 1</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 2</td> <td>8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 3</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 4</td> <td>16</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rank 5</td> <td>20</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>A Stable’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Stable.</p> <h2 id="towers--walls"> <a href="#towers--walls" aria-labelledby="towers--walls" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Towers &amp; Walls </h2> <p><em>Non-Profit</em></p> <p>Towers and Walls serve as fortifications for a community. Walls serve to surround and protect a community, keeping enemy forces out. Towers serve as strategic garrisons and lookout points, giving any stationed therein a lovely vantage of the surroundings.</p> <p>Walls must be in a relatively straight line (with some leeway for following terrain). This means that most towns that choose to surround themselves with walls will have to build at least four of them. Walls are (Rank+1) storeys tall, but their length is simply “an entire side of the town” or less.</p> <p>Walls may feature gates, allowing passage to authorized persons at a specific place along the wall. These gates may be closed and locked when passage is not permitted, such as at night or during times of war.</p> <p>Towers can be built atop Walls, or on their own, as guard outposts or lookout posts. Towers are ((Rank+1) x 2) storeys tall, and often feature portholes to fire arrows from, and a balcony that allows the placement of a Heavy Weapon or archery regiment. Towers are the tallest Buildings in most communities, rivaled only by Cultural Monuments.</p> <h3 id="master-mode-1"> <a href="#master-mode-1" aria-labelledby="master-mode-1" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Master Mode </h3> <p>Under Master Mode rules, a GM may allow those firing long-ranged weapons from atop a Tower or Wall to shoot further, taking advantage of their height. In this case, for every storey tall the shooter’s vantage is, increase their Projectile range by 1.</p> <h2 id="workshop"> <a href="#workshop" aria-labelledby="workshop" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Workshop </h2> <p><em>For-Profit</em></p> <p>Workshops allow large numbers of people to come together to work on crafting projects. They provide ways to smelt ore, cut timber, weave cloth, and otherwise turn raw materials into usable goods.</p> <p>All Workshops include a Forge. Heroes may make use of a Workshop’s Forge for their own purposes at no charge, so long as they are on good terms with the Workshop.</p> <p>A staffed Workshop can make Armor, Miscellaneous and Mundane Tools, and even Weapons for you – if you provide the raw materials, and agree to a surcharge for their services. Workshops can only make items of the Building’s Rank or lower.</p> <p>Weapons made by a Workshop’s attendants may be of a Crafting Style that the Workshop’s attendants know - for instance, Weapons made at a Workshop full of Gorons might be of the Goron style.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="rtw-table centered-bold half-width"> <thead> <tr> <th>Req.<br>Smithing Trait</th> <th>Cost of<br>Services</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Smithing 0 (Rank 0 Mats)</td> <td>100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Smithing 2 (Rank 1 Mats)</td> <td>200</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Smithing 4 (Rank 2 Mats)</td> <td>400</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Smithing 6 (Rank 3 Mats)</td> <td>600</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Smithing 8 (Rank 4 Mats)</td> <td>800</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Smithing 10 (Rank 5 Mats)</td> <td>1000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>A Workshop’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the shop.</p> <hr> <footer> <!-- {%- if page.contributors.size > 0 -%} <ul class="contributor-list"> <li class="contributor-list-item"><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contributor/">Contributors</a>:</li> {% for contributor in page.contributors %} <li class="contributor-list-item">#{% include contributors/contributor_link.html contributor=contributor %}</li> {% endfor %} {%- assign contributor = nil %} </ul> {%- endif -%} --> <p><a href="#top" id="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p> <p class="text-small text-grey-dk-000 mb-0">This is a mirror of Reclaim the Wild's supplement <i>Rebuild the Wild</i>'s ruleset and is based on the publicly available PDFs of it.
