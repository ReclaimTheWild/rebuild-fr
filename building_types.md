## Bank

*Non-Profit*

Banks provide item storage, at 25 Rupees per slot. Banks can provide up to (Rank x 10) slots of Storage per person. (This means a Rank 0 Bank can’t store any items!)

Each slot of Storage acts just like a slot of Overflow Inventory - any kind of item may go into it, and items that stack may stack as large as they like.

A Bank’s Owners have their available item storage at the Bank doubled: for example, if they have purchased 3 slots, then they have 6 available. These bonus slots do not count towards the Owners’ limit of up to (Rank x 10) Storage slots per person. If the Owners lose possession of the Bank, they can no longer place items in these bonus slots, but can still remove them at their leisure.  
Banks can also store your Rupees, to prevent them from being stolen by cutpursesor eaten by Like-Likes. 

Storing your Rupees costs nothing, and you do not need to purchase or use a Storage slot for them. You may withdraw your Rupees or your items whenever you visit the Bank in person. You may also withdraw items and Rupees from the Bank whenever you communicate with them, such as by mail - so long as you’re willing to deal with the time it takes for the post to deliver.

Rupees stored at a Bank do *not* accrue interest.

## Barracks

*Non-Profit*

Barracks allow the members of a community to organize guards or a militia, giving them an armed force to defend their settlement, patrol for lawbreakers, or respond to crises.

Barracks are staffed with ((Rank + 1) x 10) Guards. These Guards are built out as Villagers, meaning that they start with 40 Tokens to spend, and all Traits start at 1. They have an extra (Rank x 20) Tokens of Heroism to spend. Guards cannot increase a Trait above (4 + (Rank / 2)), cannot purchase any Feats, Techniques, or Skills that cost more than (4 + Rank) Tokens, and cannot purchase any Crafting Style Feats.

Guards are usually, but not necessarily, of a Race that would commonly be found in the Barracks' settlement. Guards have all the benefits and the Vulnerability of their Race.

Guards may be seen performing the following duties (among others!), as time and circumstance permit:

**Patrol the settlement,** keeping the peace and responding to crime.

**Patrol roads** to and from the settlement, searching for bandits and monsters that might cause trouble to travelers.

**Stand guard at specific locations** important to the settlement. These might be the town gates, the office of an important official, a high-value Building, or the site of recent criminal or monster activity.

**Stand watch** at the village outskirts. This allows Guards to look out for trouble on the horizon - advancing armies, fleeing criminals, or even the weather. If the settlement has Walls or Towers, the Guards may use those structures for this purpose.

**Ceremonial duties,** such as marching in parades, serving in coronations, and adding gravitas to state funerals.

Guards are assigned Weapons and Armor from the Barracks, as per the table below.

| Rank   | Guard Tokens | Head   | Chest  | Legs   | Weapon 1 | Weapon 2 |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| Rank 0 | 40           | -      | Rank 0 | Rank 0 | Rank 0   | -        |
| Rank 1 | 60           | -      | Rank 1 | Rank 0 | Rank 1   | Rank 0   |
| Rank 2 | 80           | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 1 | Rank 1   | Rank 0   |
| Rank 3 | 100          | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 1 | Rank 2   | Rank 1   |
| Rank 4 | 120          | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 2 | Rank 2   | Rank 2   |
| Rank 5 | 140          | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 2 | Rank 3   | Rank 3   |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns-100 .centered-bold }

Guards generally do not carry Tools, but if their duties require the use of one, they may substitute one of their Weapons for Mundane or Miscellaneous Tools of equal value.

A Guard's exact equipment loadout (including the Style and type of Weapon they use) may depend on their personality, the town they are stationed in, and the local availability of equipment, smiths, or materials.

A piece of a guard's Equipment may be Enchanted. They may have up to (Rank / 2) pieces of equipment enchanted, with the Enchantment Rank matching the item’s Rank. The type of Enchantment may be limited by local availability of Gems.

In general, all Guards stationed at a Barracks are built out the same way: same Traits, Equipment, Feats, Techniques, and Spells. There may be exceptions, however, as game and plot require. Guards stationed at two different Barracks in the same city will likely be built differently, however.

Typically, Barracks and their Guards are too busy with their duties to accompany Heroes on their adventures, and are generally ill-equipped to match a Hero's skill and power. However, if a Hero has proven themselves a friend of the Guards, then the Guards may deign to return the favor: with their presence, or with information they’ve gleaned while performing their duties.

The Owner of a Barracks may request a Guard accompany them as a Companion, and they do not need to further pay them for this service. Abusing this right - such as by allowing the Guard to die or unduly suffer while in their service - may have negative consequences for them. Owners of a Barracks are also the first to hear about whatever troubles the Guards of the Barracks may be dealing with of late, which may lead to additional quests and adventures.

## Cooking Co-Op

*For-Profit*

Cooking Co-Ops are communal kitchens, where community members can come together to share ingredients, recipes, and gossip. Some Cooking Co-Ops also do charity work by providing Food Ingredients or hot meals to those who need a little help.

Cooking Co-Ops provide a number of services to Heroes who visit them.

First, all Cooking Co-Ops include a Cooking Fixture. Heroes may make use of a Cooking Co-Op’s Cooking Fixture for their own purposes at no charge, so long as they are on good terms with the Co-Op.

Second, Heroes can pay a Cooking Co-Op to make a Dish for them, using Ingredients that the Heroes provide. They can only use Ingredients of a Rank equal to or less than the Rank of the Building.

| Req.<br>Cooking Trait       | Cost of<br>Services |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Cooking 0 (Rank 0 Mats)     | 10               |
| Cooking 2 (Rank 1 Mats)     | 20               |
| Cooking 4 (Rank 2 Mats)     | 40               |
| Cooking 6 (Rank 3 Mats)     | 60               |
| Cooking 8 (Rank 4 Mats)     | 80               |
| Cooking 10 (Rank 5 Mats)    | 100              |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

Third, Heroes can bring Food Ingredients to a Cooking Co-Op, and leave with another Ingredient from their community pantry. By bringing (6 – Rank) Food Ingredients and donating them to the Co-Op, the Hero may then leave with one Food Ingredient of their choice, of a Rank equal to the lowest-ranked Ingredient they donated (or the Building’s Rank, whichever is lower).

A Co-Op’s available Ingredients is limited by their biome, and may be further limited by what’s at market, what others have brought in, or other factors.

Finally, Heroes can spend time helping out in the Co-Op’s kitchens, entertaining visitors, or delivering meals to people in need. This counts as doing an Odd Job, and may earn the Hero some spare Rupees (or some Ingredients of equivalent market price, of up to the Building’s Rank).

For their Owners, Cooking Co-Ops provide one Food Ingredient, of a Rank up to the Building’s Rank, per day. This Ingredient might be close to its expiry date, and might vary with whatever the Co-Op has been able to stock of late.

## Cultural Monuments

*Non-Profit*

Cultural Monuments are a special kind of Building - they make no profits on their own, but they enhance the culture and prosperity of the community around them. Museums, Obelisks, Statues, and Temples are all examples of kinds of Cultural Monuments. Sites of historical importance, such as old battlegrounds or tombs of important historical figures, might also be built up and turned into Cultural Monuments. As public works of culture, they are of course Non-Profit.

Cultural Monuments provide a Profit Bonus to For-Profit Buildings that are adjacent to them, based on the Rank of the Statue. 

A single Cultural Monument can only be adjacent to (and thus, can only benefit) up to 8 Buildings. 

Cultural Monuments may be built within a Commons, providing the benefits of both in a single area.

Cultural Monuments may also provide other benefits to the community, such as prestige for the artisan who built them, or increased tourism in the area.

## Cultural Wonder

*Non-Profit*

A Cultural Wonder is a special kind of Cultural Monument. It represents the power, wisdom, or courage of the entire community, and can draw admirers from all the world.

A Cultural Wonder can be built like any Cultural Monument, but costs 5 times the Materials in each category and takes 5 times the duration to construct, deconstruct, upgrade, and downgrade. Cultural Wonders tend to be quite massive: temples that can be mistaken for mountains, a statue of a goddess at full scale, or a network of catacombs the size of a city. Also like a Cultural Monument, these are public works and are therefore Non-Profit.

Once built, a Cultural Wonder provides three Profit Boosts (of the Wonder’s Rank) to any For-Profit Buildings that are directly adjacent to it. All non-adjacent For-Profit Buildings in the community gain a single Profit Boost (of the Wonder’s Rank).

## Enchanter

*For-Profit*

Enchanters can enchant weapons and armor, or transmute Materials, for a price.

Enchanters can perform Enchantments or Transmutations with a required Enchanting Trait Rank of (Building Rank x2) or lower. 

Enchanters do not provide the Gems necessary for Enchantment: you must bring your own Gems for the Enchanter to use. If you wish to buy Gems, you will have to find a Gem Store and purchase from them.

All Enchanters include a Forge. Heroes may make use of an Enchanter’s Forge for their own purposes at no charge, so long as they are on good terms with the Enchanter.

| Req.<br>Enchanting Trait       | Cost of<br>Services |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Enchanting 0 (Rank 0 Mats)     | 100                 |
| Enchanting 2 (Rank 1 Mats)     | 200                 |
| Enchanting 4 (Rank 2 Mats)     | 400                 |
| Enchanting 6 (Rank 3 Mats)     | 600                 |
| Enchanting 8 (Rank 4 Mats)     | 800                 |
| Enchanting 10 (Rank 5 Mats)    | 1000                |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

An Enchanter’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the shop.

## Farm

*For-Profit*

There are two types of Farms: those that provide Food Ingredients, and those that provide Critters. Both types of Farm provide their Ingredients to the community. Among Food-producing Farms, those that specialize in fruits are “Orchards”, those that raise fish are “Fisheries”, and those that specialize in game are “Reserves”; all of them operate in the same fashion, however.

Most farms specialize in a certain type of plant or animal that they tend to - some food farms may grow wheat, others rear cattle or pigs, and some grow fruits or vegetables.

A Farm’s crops are determined upon creation, limited to what Ingredients or Critters would thrive in the farm’s biome. (This is typically based on the “Listings by Habitat” found in the Appendices of the Core Rulebook, but your game may have other Critters or Food Ingredients in your biome.)

A Farm produces (Rank+1) different types of Food or Critter Ingredient, of a Rank up to the Farm’s Rank. Thus, a Rank 3 Food Farm could sell four different kinds of Rank 3 or lower Food Materials; a Rank 2 Critter Farm could sell three different kinds of Rank 2 or lower Critters. 

A Farm will sell its wares to anyone who comes by, weather permitting. Farmhands might also deliver the goods to market on certain days, or sell their goods on the side of a well-traveled road near the Farm.

For their Owners, Farms provide 5 units ofeither Food Ingredients or Critters, of a Rank up to the Building’s Rank, and of types that the farm produces, per day. 

## Garage

*For-Profit*

Garages allow mechanically-minded people to come together to work on large, complex projects. They provide ways to take things apart, fix them, and put them back together.

All Garages include a Forge. Heroes may make use of a Garage’s Forge for their own purposes at no charge, so long as they are on good terms with the Garage.

| Req.<br>Mechanics Trait        | Cost of<br>Services |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Mechanics 0 (Rank 0 Mats)      | 100                 |
| Mechanics 2 (Rank 1 Mats)      | 200                 |
| Mechanics 4 (Rank 2 Mats)      | 400                 |
| Mechanics 6 (Rank 3 Mats)      | 600                 |
| Mechanics 8 (Rank 4 Mats)      | 800                 |
| Mechanics 10 (Rank 5 Mats)     | 1000                |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

Garages might be more useful in some worlds than others. A Hyrule still in the throes of medieval fantasy might not find much use for a Garage’s services – while a Hyrule with steam-engines, airships, or even cybernetic technology, might find a Garage’s expertise invaluable.

A Garage’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Garage’s Rank.

## Healer

*For-Profit*

Healers craft Elixirs from ingredients that people bring them - for a price. They also provide medical advice and knowledge to the community, serving as doctors, midwives, and surgeons.

All Healers include a Cooking Fixture. Heroes may make use of a Healer’s Cooking Fixture for their own purposes at no charge, so long as they are on good terms with the Healer.

A Healer can only use Ingredients of a Rank equal to or less than the Rank of the Building. The price for their services is based on the highest-Ranked ingredient to be used in the Elixir.

| Req.<br>Cooking Trait        | Cost of<br>Services |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Cooking 0 (Rank 0 Mats)      | 10                  |
| Cooking 2 (Rank 1 Mats)      | 20                  |
| Cooking 4 (Rank 2 Mats)      | 40                  |
| Cooking 6 (Rank 3 Mats)      | 60                  |
| Cooking 8 (Rank 4 Mats)      | 80                  |
| Cooking 10 (Rank 5 Mats)     | 100                 |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

A Healer’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the shop, or an Elixir of the Building’s Rank and of a type chosen by the GM (or at random).

## House

A House’s Owner can rent out the house, allowing others to live in it. When they do this, the Owner receives a small amount of Rupees per day based on the Rank of the House, much as if it were a For-Profit Shop or other Building. However, an Owner cannot then use a rented-out House for their own purposes, including as a place to rest.

If a House’s Owner does *not* rent out the house, they may use it for themselves; this is a Non-Profit use. This allows them to fill it with their own belongings, customize its colors and furnishings, and to rest there for free. When resting in a House, Heroes restore all of their Burnt and Spent Health, Magic, and Stamina, as well as gaining Temporary HP based on the Rank of the House.

Houses include a reasonable suite of furniture to fill the space - so a House always includes a bed, table, chairs, and so on. A House’s owners are free to obtain and use their own furniture, as well.

All Houses contain a kitchen, which includes a Cooking Fixture and a place to have a fire. This means that residents in a House can use it to cook without further expenditure. Houses do *not* come equipped with a Forge, however.

Houses can store up to (Rank x 4) items *per Hero*. Each slot of storage acts just like a slot of Overflow Inventory - any kind of item may go into it, and items that stack may stack as large as they like.

Be cautious of storing a large number of valuable items or materials in your home - Houses are easier to break into, and are generally less well-guarded, than a Bank of equal rank. Further, the more valuable the goods in the home, the more likely it is that thieves will strike, breaking in while any resident Heroes are away and looting the place. If you have a large number of valuable objects you wish to store for a long time, buying space at a Bank may be a better, safer option.

Finally, resting in a House provides a small amount of Temporary HP, as per the table below. Resting in a House provides no Temporary MP or Temporary SP.

| House<br>Rank | Temp HP<br>on Rest | Item Storage<br>Slots (per Hero) |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Rank 0        | 0                  | 0                                |
| Rank 1        | 2                  | 4                                |
| Rank 2        | 4                  | 8                                |
| Rank 3        | 6                  | 12                               |
| Rank 4        | 8                  | 16                               |
| Rank 5        | 10                 | 20                               |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

### Renting a House

Sometimes, Heroes may be staying in an area long enough that they won’t want to stay in an Inn room, but will not be staying long enough (or may not be rich enough) to outright buy or build their own House. In this case, they can choose to rent a House that someone else owns. 

The cost of renting is the same as the profits the Owner of a House would make per day.

Houses must be rented for a minimum of 5 days at a time, and are rented in increments of 5 days thereafter - so Inn rooms are more efficient if you intend to spend only a night or two in town, or if you need to leave at a moment’s notice.

Not every community will have Houses for rent - it’s not a guarantee, especially in smaller communities where there are few travelers and no real estate market.

## Inn

*For-Profit*

Inns allow travelers, Heroes, and tourists to stay the night away from their own beds and without camping outdoors, for a per-day fee.

A single Inn room can support a group of Heroes comfortably, and includes a nourishing (albeit benefit-less) breakfast. (In Master Mode, this serves to stave off Hunger following an Extended Rest.)

An Inn’s comfortable beds and luxurious services provide a full night’s rest, restoring all Spent and Burned Health, Magic, and Stamina. They also provide an amount of Temporary Points to anyone who spends an Extended Rest there, based on the Rank of the Inn. (This is some combination of HP, MP, and/or SP, determined when the Inn is constructed, adding up to the total Temp Points provided by that Rank of Inn.)

| Building<br>Rank | Cost of<br>a Room | Temp<br>Points |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Rank 0           | 25                | 0              |
| Rank 1           | 50                | 4              |
| Rank 2           | 100               | 8              |
| Rank 3           | 200               | 12             |
| Rank 4           | 500               | 16             |
| Rank 5           | 1000              | 20             |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

Inns often serve as a hub for travelers to mingle and share information. In addition, when locals decide they need the help of Heroes, they will often visit the local Inn first, knowing that any traveling adventurers or mercenaries are likely to be rooming there. If Heroes are unsure of what to do next, are in need of some work for a little extra money, could use an extra hand, or want to hear local rumors, they should hang around the Inn – and the GM should take this as a sign to throw them a bone, and provide a short, low-stakes adventure for them to partake in.

All Inns provide a Cooking Fixture for Heroes to cook their own Dishes: smaller Inns might just have a single communal cooking area, while fancier Inns may provide each room with their own private kitchen.

An Inn’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Inn.

### Master Mode

Under Master Mode rules, a GM may allow a Hero’s Humanoid Companions to register at an Inn, just as if it were a Stable. They gain the same Temporary HP benefits they would at a Stable of the same Rank (see [Stables]() for more information).

## Library / Book Store

*For-Profit*

Libraries and Book Stores both serve a similar purpose - to give their community access to literature and knowledge.

Both have Written Books of a quality up to the shop’s Rank. The Written Books they have available depends on the Building’s owners, location, culture, and a host of other factors, as the GM decides. Neither Libraries nor Book Stores sell Empty Books or Ink & Quill sets; to purchase those, visit (or build!) a Tool Shop with the appropriate wares.

Book Stores sell their Books directly. Libraries, however, only loan their Books out. A Library will loan out a single Book per person, for a period of 10 days. 

After that, they begin charging late fees, accruing every day until the Book is returned, equal to 10% of the Book’s sale cost (typically 20% of the Book’s Market Price). Heroes are unable to borrow books from a Library while they have an outstanding late fee. If they fail to return a valuable enough Book for a long enough time, some Libraries may decide to take more drastic measures to regain their property.

A Library’s or Book Store’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Building. They may instead rarely receive a random free Written Book of the Building’s Rank instead of a day’s profits.

## Mill

*For-Profit*

Mills produce resource nodes (opportunities to harvest Materials) at a steady pace. They provide towns with regular, safe access to harvestable resources, without having to venture into the dangerous wilderness.

Mills come in a variety of forms, each dedicated to a single type of Material from natural resources in the surrounding area.

| Material Type | Building Name   |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Ancient       | Excavation Site |
| Cloth         | Magnanery       |
| Gemstone      | Motherlode      |
| Metal         | Mine            |
| Monster Parts | Furrier         |
| Stone         | Quarry          |
| Wood          | Lumber Mill     |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

**Mills may only produce resource nodes of their chosen type of Material.** This Material type is chosen when the Building is first constructed, and cannot be changed later. In the case of Gemstones, a Mill produces only a single type of Gem – for instance, a Motherlode specifically producing Onyxes.

**Mills may only be built where there’s an obvious abundance of that Material type.** For instance, a Lumber Mill can only be built in or near a verdant, lush forest. This means that you may not be able to build some types of Mills, depending on where you are!

Customers may purchase resource nodes from a Mill, to harvest themselves. The below are Market Prices, and should be modified by haggling as per usual.

| Rank   | Market Price |
|--------|--------------|
| Rank 0 | 50           |
| Rank 1 | 100          |
| Rank 2 | 200          |
| Rank 3 | 400          |
| Rank 4 | 1000         |
| Rank 5 | 2000         |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

A Mill’s owners receive a free resource node of the Mill’s type and Rank once every (6 – (Rank / 2)) days. These resource nodes can all be harvested in a single attempt, whenever the owners deign to return and collect on them.

| Rank   | Days per Node |
|--------|---------------|
| Rank 0 | 6             |
| Rank 1 | 5             |
| Rank 2 | 5             |
| Rank 3 | 4             |
| Rank 4 | 4             |
| Rank 5 | 3             |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

**A Note on Furriers:** Unlike other Mills’ nodes, a Furrier’s “nodes” do not use a Trait roll. Instead, you make a simple Luck roll to see how many Monster Parts – tufts of fur, claw sheaths, and shed horns, etc. – the Furrier’s humane methods have scavenged.

That formula is:  
**(5 - Rank) + (((2d6 + (Rank x 3)) / 5)**

## Minigame

*For-Profit*

Minigames might take two forms: an actual small game that the GM invents, or an Extended Challenge. As an Extended Challenge, they last 3 Rounds, and have a Difficulty Level up to the Minigame’s maximum available (per the table to the right). Minigames may either be for an individual Hero or an entire party, and they may be for whatever Trait or Traits make the most sense for how the Minigame is described.

A Minigame’s Owners can decide just what game they offer, but a community can only support a single instance of any one game.

Any given Minigame can only be attempted by a given Hero once per day.

The higher Rank the Minigame is, the more difficulty levels it offers - providing a higher DC to meet, but granting a higher reward for doing so. Heroes may choose what Difficulty they want to try the Minigame at when they 
attempt it.

To play a Minigame, the Hero making the attempt must first pay up a certain amount of money based on the level of the Mini-Game Level they’re going to play. When they win the Minigame, Heroes typically win back twice what they paid (or items of that value), though they may instead win other prizes, based on the individual running the Minigame and circumstances.

A Minigame’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on its Rank.

| Building Rank | Minigame Level | Cost |
|---------------|----------------|------|
| Rank 0        | Novice         | 20   |
| Rank 1        | Journeyman     | 50   |
| Rank 2        | Adept          | 100  |
| Rank 3        | Expert         | 200  |
| Rank 4        | Impressive     | 500  |
| Rank 5        | Heroic         | 1000 |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .width-70 }

### Example Minigames

**Bombchu Bowling**: Stand on a spinning platform, and hit targets on the walls with Bombchu. *Solo/Team, Focused Challenge: Accuracy*

**Chest Choice**: Randomly select a Treasure Chest from many. Purely luck-based. Sometimes called the “Money Making Game”. *Solo, Focused Challenge: Luck rolls (no Traits)*

**Dance Hall**: Try to keep up with faster and faster dances. *One or Two Players, Focused Challenge: Perform*

**Digging Game**: Try to dig up as much treasure as you can. *Solo/Team, Mixed Challenge: Athletics, Perception, Fortitude*

## Observatory / Fortune Teller

*For-Profit*

Observatories gaze up to the stars, while Fortune Tellers gaze into crystal balls. The result is the same - they both attempt to predict the future.

Observatories and Fortune Tellers can be employed to perform the Song “Future’s Fugue”, with a Musical Power equal to (Building Rank x2). The exact method of their performance may vary - be it tea leaves, careful charting of the stars, or even stranger actions. The person performing the augury will relay the information they receive as best and as truthfully as they can - though they may not always understand the answers they receive.

| Building Rank | Cost of Fortune |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Rank 1        | 100             |
| Rank 2        | 200             |
| Rank 3        | 400             |
| Rank 4        | 1000            |
| Rank 5        | 2000            |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

An Observatory or Fortune Teller’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Building.

## Office

*For-Profit*

Offices allow the citizens of a settlement to organize their affairs, keep track of their efforts and their expenditures, and to house bureaucracies, governments, or large businesses. An Office might also represent a school, guild of tradespeople, or other place of dedicated learning.

Offices provide Heroes a place to go to find experts on a given subject. If the Heroes need information on an ancient artefact, receipts for the mayor’s expenditures, or experience with a foreign country’s culture, they can turn to the Workers of a relevant Office to provide much-needed knowledge.

An Office’s benefits to the community are both varied and subtle.

**Offices provide employment.** Some people aren’t cut out to be a farmer, merchant, or guard. For those who prefer to deal with facts and ideas, an Office is an ideal workplace.

**Offices promote efficiency.** Offices serve as a central authority, keeping Workers on-track even if they aren’t aware of the bigger picture. An Office also ensures that money and materials are spent wisely.

**Offices educate citizens.** Even if an Office is not explicitly a place of scholarly pursuits, its workers still learn valuable knowledge and skills that they otherwise couldn’t obtain.

**Offices prevent corruption.** An Office keeps track of paperwork and expenditures, making sure no money or materials “happen” to go missing. Workers are paid, promoted, and recognized based on their merits, reducing the risk of them even attempting to corrupt the system.

Office Workers are rarely, if ever, fully built out as characters. If the need arises, assume they are Villagers with Traits relevant to their chosen career of (4 + (Rank / 2)). Highly-regarded Workers may also have the Specialist Feat up to (Rank / 2) times, focusing on different aspects of their job.

Workers are usually, but not necessarily, of a Race that would commonly be found in the Office’s settlement. Workers have all the benefits and the Vulnerability of their Race.

An Office’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Office’s Rank.

## Performance Hall

*For-Profit*

A home for music, dancing, and other performing arts, townsfolk can depend on the Performance Hall to provide them with an evening of entertainment. These Buildings stage plays, dances, musical revues, or other artistic shows.

However, Performance Halls can also offer Heroes their services, performing from their repertoire of known Magical Songs.

A Performance Hall has access to a number of Magical Songs, based on its Rank. These Songs are chosen when the Performance Hall is built, and are permanent. When built by Heroes, a Performance Hall’s Songs are chosen from those that the Heroes know.

| Building Rank | Song Repertoire         |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Rank 0        | 1 Minor Song            |
| Rank 1        | 1 Minor Song            |
| Rank 2        | 2 Minor Songs           |
| Rank 3        | 2 Minor & 1 Major Song  |
| Rank 4        | 3 Minor & 2 Major Songs |
| Rank 5        | 3 Minor & 3 Major Songs |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .width-70 }

(The GM may disallow certain Songs from being in a Performance Hall’s repertoire.)

Performance Halls won’t give up their Songs to just anyone, no matter how heavy their Rupee pouch is; you cannot buy Songs from them. However, if you find a Performance Hall that knows a Song you’d like to learn, try asking how you can help them – and perhaps one good deed will spur another.

A Performance Hall can be asked to perform a particular Song in their repertoire, allowing a Hero to reap its benefits without putting in the practice and effort needed to master the performing arts.

A Performance Hall’s company can perform Magical Songs with a Perform Trait of (Building Rank x2) or lower. If a Song would only target its performer, or some group that includes the performer, the Performance Hall may instead have the Song target some other person(s) currently within the Building, such as the Hero who commissioned the performance and/or their nearby friends.

A Performance Hall can only put on one Major and one Minor show in a given day.

| Req. Trait | Cost of Services |
|------------|------------------|
| Perform 2  | 200              |
| Perform 4  | 400              |
| Perform 6  | 600              |
| Perform 8  | 800              |
| Perform 10 | 1000             |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

A Performance Hall’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Building.

## Port

*For-Profit*

Ports are places where ships come and go, carrying people and goods; they are the life-blood of a coastal economy. Ports serve as places to book passage on vehicles, allowing Heroes to travel farther and faster than they might otherwise be able to – but only to those places that captains are willing to take them.

The Rank of a Port dictates the kinds of destinations that a Hero can book passage to. The more distant or difficult the journey, the more expensive the fare. The purchase of a fare covers an entire party of Heroes, anything they can carry, and any Companions in tow. If sending goods in bulk, a single fare can hold up to (fare’s Rank x 10) slots of items, much like a Bank. Typically, one can only book passage to other civilized places that have their own Ports, though exceptions might be made by brave or foolhardy captains (or Heroes willing to throw more Rupees around). 

Below is a chart featuring a rough idea of the distance of fare one can book from a Port of a given Rank, how long such a journey might take (at most), and how much the fare costs.

| Building Rank | Distance Travelable     | Journey's Timeframe | Fare Cost   |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 0             | Across the Harbor       | A few hours         | 100 Rupees  |
| 1             | Across a Lake           | ½ a day             | 200 Rupees  |
| 2             | Across a Channel        | A day               | 400 Rupees  |
| 3             | Across an Inland Sea    | A week              | 800 Rupees  |
| 4             | Across an Ocean         | A month             | 2000 Rupees |
| 5             | To Another World's Seas | Instantly           | 4000 Rupees |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns-100 .centered-first-column }

In addition, should a Hero happen to own a proper vehicle, they can register them at the Port, for 100 Rupees. Once registered, the Port’s personnel will mind the vehicle and keep watch over it, allowing the Hero to venture off knowing that their conveyance will be properly cared for. This registration is a one-time fee, no matter how many Ports a Hero might visit with their vehicle.

Heroes may use a Port to freely summon a vehicle housed at a different Port, in order to make use of it - in some games, the vehicle in question may have to physically traverse the distance themselves, while in others, Ports can instantly transport vehicles through the power of magic.

Traditionally, Ports are focused on water-faring vessels, and thus can only be built in places with significant water access (such as on the edge of a lake, on the ocean shore, or along a large river). In some games, however, there may be air-ports servicing dirigibles or jet-planes, travelcenters that offer public transit over land routes, or space-ports to service rockets and starships.  
A Port can only service one type of vessel (land, sea, air, space, etc.), chosen when the Port is first constructed.

A Port’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Port. In addition, once a month (30 days), the Port’s Owners can book free passage for themselves and their friends on a vehicle that just so happened to be travelling where they needed to go.

## Post Office

*For-Profit*

Post Offices can deliver letters, for 10 Rupees, or packages, for 25 Rupees. A letter may only contain written correspondence, while a package may contain both a letter and a single item (or stack of a single item).

All postal deliveries take one day to reach their destination. Typically, if you’re awaiting a response, it will take about three days - one day to deliver your missive, one day for the recipient to compose a response, and a third day for their response to reach you.

All deliveries must start at the post office (there is no daily at-home pickup). Postmen can deliver mail to specific addresses, such as homes or businesses. They can also deliver directly to a person’s hands, if they catch sight of them on their route.

However, no Post Office can deliver to a place it is unaware of, or one that is hidden away or shielded by magic - if a normal person (with directions and proper conveyance) couldn’t get there, then neither can the postman.

**At Rank 0**, there aren’t any actual postmen to make deliveries; the Post Office is simply a place where messages can be dropped off and picked up. People wishing to exchange messages will have to visit the Post Office to receive their mail, or to send replies.

**At Rank 1**, the Post Office becomes capable of making simple deliveries. Messengers can deliver letters and packages to anyone within a small radius around the Post Office (about the size of a small village).

**At Rank 2**, the Post Office’s effective radius increases, to about the size of a large city, or a village and much of its surrounding countryside.

**At Rank 3**, a Post Office can deliver to most anywhere within a country.

**At Rank 4**, the Post Office is capable of delivering packages and letters to nearly anywhere in the world, by land or sea (or in some cases, air). The postmen will use magical means to make the journey, if necessary. Fantastical realms that are still in the same metaphysical world, such as a kingdom in the clouds or hidden deep in the earth, may or may not be available.

**At Rank 5**, these postmen are capable of traveling to anywhere in the world, or any other world, and deliver any message or package within a day. They can shuttle messages between the Light and Dark World, the Twilight Kingdom, or any other worlds your campaign might have.

A Post Office’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Post Office. However, some days (at the GM’s whims) their earnings may be replaced by receiving a random item from the ‘undeliverable packages’ pile. A Post Office’s Owners may also send (Rank) letters or packages per day, for free.

## Shop

*For-Profit*

Shops offer mundane items, of a Rank equal to the Rank of the shop. Different kinds of shops sell different kinds of things.

Listed below are some of the types of shops that Heroes might find in many cities and towns the world over.

| Shop Type              | Sells...                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Alchemist or Witch     | Elixirs                            |
| Armorer                | Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor     |
| Arsenal or Weapon Shop | All Types of Weapons               |
| Bomb Shop              | Bombs                              |
| Breeder                | Critter Ingredients                |
| Farmer’s Market        | Food Ingredients                   |
| Fashion Boutique       | Civilian Clothing (in many styles) |
| Fletcher               | Arrows                             |
| General Store          | Anything, but in limited supply    |
| Hardware or Tool Shop  | Mundane & Miscellaneous Tools      |
| Jeweler                | Gem Materials                      |
| Lumber Yard            | Wood Materials                     |
| Mason                  | Stone Materials                    |
| Refinery               | Metal Materials                    |
| Restaurant             | Dishes                             |
| Scrapyard              | Ancient Materials                  |
| Seamstress             | Cloth Materials                    |
| Taxidermist or Hunter  | Monster Parts                      |
{: .rtw-table .width-70 }

Unless otherwise noted, all Shops have enough stock at-hand to satisfy all but the most ludicrous order a Hero could place. This may not be the case if a Shop is suffering in some way, such as from political sanctions, stolen or lost deliveries, or if they’re in a city under siege.

### What Does Each Shop Sell?

**Shops that sell Materials** – meaning Jewelers, Lumber Yards, Masons, Refineries, Scrapyards, Seamstresses, and Taxidermists – sell Materials of up to their Rank. For example, a Rank 3 Lumber Yard can sell Rank 0, 1, 2, or 3 Wood Materials.

**Hardware Stores** sell all types of Mundane and Miscellaneous Tools, of up to their Rank. For instance, a Rank 3 Hardware Store can sell Rank 0, 1, 2, or 3 Shovels.

**Armories, Arsenals, and Fashion Boutiques** sell all Armor, Weapons, or Clothing (respectively). The items on offer are of a Rank up to the Building’s Rank. Arsenals typically offer their Weapons in only a single Crafting Style (if any), though the right Employee may allow them to source a second Style.

Armories, Arsenals, and Fashion Boutiques also keep (Rank) many unique, already-enchanted, one-off items behind the counter, of a Rank up to (but not always equal to!) the Shop’s Rank. These items may have some history to them, but they’re always one-offs, and are almost certain to be sold to someone else if the Heroes do not snatch them up today.

**Alchemists, Witches, and Restaurants** offer a limited selection of pre-made consumables. They offer ((2 x Rank) + 1) different kinds of items, of a Rank up to the Shop’s Rank. Restaurants offer Dishes, while Alchemists and Witches offer Elixirs.

**Fletchers and Bomb Shops** unlock new wares with every Rank, per the table below.

| Rank   | Fletcher                          | Bomb Shop                   |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Rank 0 | Arrow                             | Bomb                        |
| Rank 1 | Broadhead Arrow, Hammerhead Arrow | Firework, Flashbang         |
| Rank 2 | Bomb Arrow                        | Bombchu, Fireproof Bomb     |
| Rank 3 | Showstopper Arrow, Snag Arrow     | Remote Bomb, Water Bomb     |
| Rank 4 | Elemental Arrows (all Elements)   | Super Bomb, all other Bombs |
| Rank 5 | Guardian Arrow, Silver Arrow      | Powder Keg                  |
{: .rtw-table .first-small-column .centered-first-column }

**Farmer’s Markets and Breeders** function a little differently than other Shops that sell Materials. Their selection is based on the different foods or creatures that they have access to – typically, those found locally. Each offers ((2 x Rank) + 1) different kinds of Materials, each of a Rank up to (but not necessarily equal to) the Building’s Rank.

**General Stores** sell a little bit of everything - literally. Their wares are more varied, and their stock more limited, than any other shop type. They offer ((Rank + 1) x 4) different individual things, which could be Tools, Weapons, Armor, Materials, Dishes, Elixirs, or nearly anything else.

In all cases, however, a General Store’s stock of each item is limited: they will only have one of a Weapon, Armor, or Tool; and only five of a Material, Dish, or Elixir. When the General Store resupplies (roughly every (6 – Rank) days), the available wares may change a little, somewhat, or entirely.

Regardless of the type of Shop, a Shop’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the shop. A Shop’s Owners may choose to take their payment in the form of equivalent wares from the Shop’s stock, valued at market price.

## Stables

*For-Profit*

Stables allow Heroes to register their Mounts and Companions for 50 Rupees per each Mount or Companion. Mounts and Companions registered at a Stable may reside there for as long as their Hero likes, allowing said Hero to take a different Mount or Companion with them on their journey.  
This registration is a one-time fee, no matter how many Stables a Hero might visit.

Mounts are well-fed and exercised while at a Stable, and Companions will typically find benign ways to occupy their time, either by working at the Stable, or enjoying the surrounding town or countryside.

Further, Heroes may use a Stable to freely summon a Mount or Companion residing at a different Stable, in order to make use of them - in some games, the Mount or Companion in question may have to physically traverse the distance themselves, while in others, Stables can instantly transport Companions and Mounts through the power of magic.

In addition, Stables provide any stabled Mounts and Companions with temporary HP, based on the quality of the Building, when the Companion is stabled at the Building for an Extended Rest.

| Building Rank | Temp HP |
|---------------|---------|
| Rank 0        | 0       |
| Rank 1        | 4       |
| Rank 2        | 8       |
| Rank 3        | 12      |
| Rank 4        | 16      |
| Rank 5        | 20      |
{: .rtw-table .centered-bold .half-width }

A Stable’s Owners get a small portion of their earnings, based on the Rank of the Stable. 

## Towers & Walls

*Non-Profit*

Towers and Walls serve as fortifications for a community. Walls serve to surround and protect a community, keeping enemy forces out. Towers serve as strategic garrisons and lookout points, giving any stationed therein a lovely vantage of the surroundings.

Walls must be in a relatively straight line (with some leeway for following terrain). This means that most towns that choose to surround themselves with walls will have to build at least four of them. Walls are (Rank+1) storeys tall, but their length is simply “an entire side of the town” or less. 

Walls may feature gates, allowing passage to authorized persons at a specific place along the wall. These gates may be closed and locked when passage is not permitted, such as at night or during times of war.

Towers can be built atop Walls, or on their own, as guard outposts or lookout posts. Towers are ((Rank+1) x 2) storeys tall, and often feature portholes to fire arrows from, and a balcony that allows the placement of a Heavy Weapon or archery regiment. Towers are the tallest Buildings in most communities, rivaled only by Cultural Monuments.

### Master Mode

Under Master Mode rules, a GM may allow those firing long-ranged weapons from atop a Tower or Wall to shoot further, taking advantage of their height. In this case, for every storey tall the shooter’s vantage is, increase their Projectile range by 1.

## Workshop

*For-Profit*

Workshops allow large numbers of people to come together to work on crafting projects. They provide ways to smelt ore, cut timber, weave cloth, and otherwise turn raw materials into usable goods.

All Workshops include a Forge. Heroes may make use of a Workshop’s Forge for their own purposes at no charge, so long as they are on good terms with the Workshop.

A staffed Workshop can make Armor, Miscellaneous and Mundane Tools, and even Weapons for you – if you provide the raw materials, and agree to a surcharge for their services. Workshops can only make items of the Building’s Rank or lower.

Weapons made by a Workshop’s attendants may be of a Crafting Style that the Workshop’s attendants know - for instance, Weapons made at a Workshop full of Gorons might be of the Goron style. 

| Req.<br>Smithing Trait       | Cost of<br>Services |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Smithing 0 (Rank 0 Mats)     | 100                 |
| Smithing 2 (Rank 1 Mats)     | 200                 |
| Smithing 4 (Rank 2 Mats)     | 400                 |
