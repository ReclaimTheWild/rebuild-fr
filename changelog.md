## Version 2.03

- [Here]({{ "/buildings_new_rules#building-purpose" | absolute_url }}): Created two new keywords: For-Profit and Non-Profit. These keywords should help clarify which buildings benefit from Profit Boosts.
- [Here]({{ "/buildings_new_rules#profit-boost" | absolute_url }}): Profit Boosts have been added to standardize the effects of Cultural Monuments and easily allow other sources.
- [Here]({{ "/buildings_new_rules#employees" | absolute_url }}): To fit with the new Profit Boosts, the Employee section has been moved next to it, and the Receiving Patronage and Magical Blessings sections have been added as other sources of Profit Boosts.
- [Here]({{ "/buildings_new_rules#breaking-and-entering" | absolute_url }}): Clarified that it takes a single Extended Rest to repair a single wall of a Building.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types" | absolute_url }}): Added in the For-Profit and Non-Profit keywords for each Building, to clarify which benefit from Profit Boosts.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#cooking-co-op" | absolute_url }}), [Here]({{ "/building_types#enchanter" | absolute_url }}), [Here]({{ "/building_types#garage" | absolute_url }}), and [Here]({{ "/building_types#healer" | absolute_url }}): The Crafting tables for Cooking Co-Op, Enchanter, Garage, and Healer have been standardized to look like the Crafting table for the Workshop.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#cooking-co-op" | absolute_url }}), [Here]({{ "/building_types#healer" | absolute_url }}), [Here]({{ "/building_types#house" | absolute_url }}), and [Here]({{ "/building_types#inn" | absolute_url }}): Cooking Fixtures have been added to the descriptions of Cooking Co-Op, Healer, House, and Inn.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#cultural-monuments" | absolute_url }}) and [Here]({{ "/building_types#cultural-wonder" | absolute_url }}): Cultural Monuments’ and Wonders’ effects are standardized as Profit Boosts.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#cultural-wonder" | absolute_url }}): Cultural Wonders now take 5 times the duration to construct, deconstruct, upgrade, and downgrade. Making the Temple of Time shouldn’t be done in a weekend!
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#enchanter" | absolute_url }}): Added in a line to the Enchanter’s chart showing the cost of creating Rank 0 Enchantments.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#healer" | absolute_url }}): Clarified that a Healer can use Ingredients of a Rank equal to or less than the Rank of the Healer.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#minigame" | absolute_url }}): Added in that Minigame Owners get Profits.
- [Here]({{ "/building_types#what-does-each-shop-sell" | absolute_url }}): Added a comma in the listing of example Shovel ranks.
- [Here]({{ "/amenity_types#commons" | absolute_url }}): Removed the paragraph in the Commons section that mentions “Cooking Pot”. No 2-for-1 Amenity building!
- [Here]({{ "/amenity_types#cooking-fixture" | absolute_url }}): Added in the Cooking Fixture, to codify the “immovable Cooking Vessel that holds 5 Ingredients regardless of rank” that has been mentioned a few times in Rebuild.
- [Here]({{ "/castles#-for-the-owner" | absolute_url }}): Cooking Fire has been renamed to Cooking Fixture.
