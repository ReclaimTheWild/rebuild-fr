<span>*</span> Rupees: Specifically, Rupees equal to the Market Value of 15 Materials of that Rank. This price cannot be haggled, and is unaffected by a Hero’s Influence.

† Desired Materials: Mills require 5 units of the Material type they’re intended to produce. In the case of Gems, this must be the specific type of Gem (such as Amber, Opal, or Sapphire).

§ Wagon: Ports require a Wagon, of the Port’s designated travel-type (land, sea, air, etc.)

‡ Special: Most Shops require 3 individual items, of the type of their intended wares. (Shops that sell Materials instead require 15 units of their intended Material type.)

NOTE:  
Stone cannot be used to replace Rupees, Desired Materials, Wagons, or Special requirements. However, it can be used to replace any other Materials, on a one-to-one basis.
